# Oofie's Codename Scripts


These are all my scripts I've made for [Friday Night Funkin': Codename Engine](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine).

Scripts include:


[BaseUI](https://github.com/oofienoob/codename-scripts/blob/main/BaseUI.hx) - A Softcoded Port of the Base FNF UI, includes a smooth healthbar (like the new base game update) and Camera Move on Note hit.
