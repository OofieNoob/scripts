# Oofie's Scripts


These are all my softcoded scripts I've made.

Scripts include:


[BaseUI](https://github.com/oofienoob/scripts/blob/main/BaseUI.hx) - A softcoded port of the Base FNF UI, includes a smooth healthbar (like the new base game update) and camera move on note hit.

[AspectRatios](https://github.com/oofienoob/scripts/blob/main/AspectRatios.hx) - A script where you can change the aspect ratio of a certain song.
